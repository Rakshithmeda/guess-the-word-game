## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If you see an error about port 5000 being in use, you can run on a different port:
```bash
python app.py
```
Then modify the last line in `app.py` to:
```python
app.run(debug=True, port=5001)
```

### Module Not Found Error
Make sure you've activated the virtual environment and installed all requirements:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Database Issues
If you encounter database errors, delete the `guessword.db` file and restart the application. It will create a fresh database.
